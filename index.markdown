I am Awalin Sopan, a data scientist focusing on data visualization and human-centered AI. I build data platforms enabling users to gain meaningful insights.  I like to bring people from different teams together and work closely with product users. I am currently a [White House Presidential Innovation Fellow](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/fellows/awalin-sopan/), serving the US Small Business Administration as a strategic advisor on data and analytics.

I earned my Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on data science and interactive visual analytics from the University of Maryland (Human-Computer Interaction Lab), College Park. I developed platforms to monitor machine learning models and incorporated such models into cyber analysts’ workflow. I have built data science applications to tackle cyber-attacks collaborating with several teams; worked with healthcare workers and online community leaders analyzing public health and social network data. I have been published in IEEE VIS, SocialComp, KDD, and SIGCHI.

## AI Total: Analyzing Security ML Models with Imperfect Data in Production
In a fully automatic deployment pipeline of ML Models, it is difficult to understand if any observed performance issues are due to model performance, pipeline issues, emerging data distribution biases, or some combination of the above. I developed a web-based visual analytics system that allows users to quickly gather headline performance numbers while maintaining confidence that the underlying data pipeline is functioning properly. It also enables us to immediately observe the root cause of an issue.

## Reverse Engineering the Analyst: Building Machine Learning Models for the SOC

What if we could train a machine to make the same analytical decisions as an experienced cyber analyst, within an acceptable level of confidence? I developed an ML system that classifies cyber events based on SOC analysts' approach to classifying them and published a paper and patent based on the analysis of the model's efficacy.

# Other Projects and Publications #

## Conference Monitor ##

I developed a real-time web app to monitor the backchannel conversation (on Twitter) during academic conferences or any live event.[Paper: SocInfo'12]

## Distribution Column Overview ## 

I developed a novel way of exploring distribution data that provides an overview of distribution data and facilitates the discovery of interesting clusters, patterns, outliers, and relationships between distribution columns. [Paper: Int'l Journal of HCI]

## ManyNets ##

I co-developed this visual analytic tool for network analysis with the tabular interface. It visualizes up to several thousand network overviews and allows network comparison. [VAST Mini Challenge AWARD]

## G-Pare ##

I developed this visual analytic tool to compare uncertain graphs, provide different views to see the overview of two graphs, as well as focus views that show subsets of nodes of interest. [Paper: VAST '11]

## Wrong Patient Error ##
I developed this project investigating the user interface and human factor issues in EHR systems that cause the problem of selecting the wrong patient. We suggest user interface techniques that can avoid this class of error and improve patient safety.
