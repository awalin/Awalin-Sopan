I am Awalin Sopan, a data scientist focusing on data visualization and human-centered AI. I build data platforms enabling users to gain meaningful insights. I earned my Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on data science and interactive visual analytics from the University of Maryland (Human-Computer Interaction Lab), College Park. I have been published in IEEE VIS, SocialComp, KDD, and SIGCHI. As a principal engineer, I developed platforms to monitor machine learning models and incorporated such models into cyber analysts’ workflow. I have built data science applications to tackle cyber-attacks collaborating with 3 different teams; worked with healthcare workers and online community leaders analyzing public health and social network data. I like to bring people from different teams together and work closely with product users. I am currently a [White House Presidential Innovation Fellow](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/fellows/awalin-sopan/), serving the US Small Business Administration as a strategic advisor on data and analytics.

## AI Total: Analyzing Security ML Models with Imperfect Data in Production

In a fully automatic deployment pipeline of ML Models, it is difficult to understand if any observed performance issues are due to model performance, pipeline issues, emerging data distribution biases, or some combination of the above. I built an analytics platform that allows users to quickly gather headline performance numbers while maintaining confidence that the underlying data pipeline is functioning properly. It also enables us to immediately observe the root cause of an issue when something goes wrong.

## Reverse Engineering the Analyst: Building Machine Learning Models for the SOC

What if we could train a machine to make the same analytical decisions as an analyst, within an acceptable level of confidence? I developed an ML system that classifies cyber events based on SOC analysts' approach to classifying them and published a paper and patent based on the analysis of the model's efficacy.
