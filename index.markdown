I am Awalin Sopan, a data scientist focusing on data visualization and human-centered AI. 

I build data platforms enabling users to gain meaningful insights. I earned my Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on data science and interactive visual analytics from the University of Maryland (Human-Computer Interaction Lab), College Park. As a principal data science engineer I developed platforms to monitor machine learning models and incorporated such models into cyber analysts’ workflow. I also built data science applications to tackle cyber-attacks collaborating with 3 different teams. I also worked with healthcare workers and online community leaders analyzing public health and social network data. I like to bring people from different teams together and work closely with the product users. 

I have been published in IEEE VIS, SocialComp, KDD and SIGCHI. I am always ready to mentor and volunteer to increase the participation of women and BIPOC in STEM fields. I enjoy watching stand-up comedy and exploring the ever-evolving DC restaurant scene and the amazing national parks across the US. My family is spread across three continents speaking multiple languages, making me even more appreciative of the different landscapes, cultures & cuisines around the world.

Analyzing Security ML Models with Imperfect Data in Production: Once a machine learning model gets deployed into production, we need to move away from static dataset evaluation to automatically evaluating performance on new incoming data. This sounds simpler than it is practice, mainly because in a fully automatic pipeline it is difficult to understand if any observed performance issues are due to model performance, pipeline issues, emerging data distribution biases, or some combination of the above. We need a shared source of truth where all the teams can have a common situational awareness of what is going on with our models. Considering all these use-cases, we built a real-time visualization dashboard that helps our team to fulfill these goals: 

* Monitor the deployed models’ regular performance, observe time trends, and detect anomalies 
* Detect issue with the evaluation data, models, or labeling 
* Investigate the reasons behind the issues 
This web-based visualization system allows the users to quickly gather headline performance numbers while maintaining confidence that the underlying data pipeline is functioning properly. It also enables us to immediately observe the root cause of an issue when something goes wrong.
