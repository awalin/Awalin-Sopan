I am Awalin Sopan (she/they), a data scientist focusing on data visualization and human-centered AI. 

I build data platforms enabling users to gain meaningful insights. I earned my Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on data science and interactive visual analytics from the University of Maryland (Human-Computer Interaction Lab), College Park. As a principal data science engineer I developed platforms to monitor machine learning models and incorporated such models into cyber analysts’ workflow. I also built data science applications to tackle cyber-attacks collaborating with 3 different teams. I also worked with healthcare workers and online community leaders analyzing public health and social network data. I like to bring people from different teams together and work closely with the product users. 

I have been published in IEEE VIS, SocialComp, KDD and SIGCHI. I am always ready to mentor and volunteer to increase the participation of women and BIPOC in STEM fields. I enjoy watching stand-up comedy and exploring the ever-evolving DC restaurant scene and the amazing national parks across the US. My family is spread across three continents speaking multiple languages, making me even more appreciative of the different landscapes, cultures & cuisines around the world.
