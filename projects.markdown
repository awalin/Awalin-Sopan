## Distribution Column Overview ## 
I developed a novel way of exploring distribution data that provides an overview of distribution data, and facilitates the discovery of interesting clusters, patterns, outliers and relationships between distribution-columns. [Paper: Int'l Journal of HCI]

## G-Pare ##
I developed this visual analytic tool to compare uncertain graphs, provides different views to see the overview of two graphs, as well as focused views that show subsets of nodes of interest. [Paper: VAST '11]

## Wrong Patient Error ##
I developed this project investigating the user interface and human factor issues in EHR systems that cause the problem of selecting a wrong patient. We suggest user interface techniques that can avoid this class of error and improve patient safety.
