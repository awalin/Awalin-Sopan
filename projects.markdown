## AI Total: Analyzing Security ML Models with Imperfect Data in Production
In a fully automatic deployment pipeline of ML Models, it is difficult to understand if any observed performance issues are due to model performance, pipeline issues, emerging data distribution biases, or some combination of the above. Considering all these use cases, we built a real-time visualization dashboard that helps to fulfill these goals: 

* Monitor the deployed modelsâ€™ regular performance, observe time trends, and detect anomalies 
* Detect issues with the evaluation data, models, or labeling 
* Investigate the reasons behind the issues 
This web-based visualization system allows users to quickly gather headline performance numbers while maintaining confidence that the underlying data pipeline is functioning properly. It also enables us to immediately observe the root cause of an issue when something goes wrong. 

## Reverse Engineering the Analyst: Building Machine Learning Models for the SOC

What if we could train a machine to make the same analytical decisions as an experienced cyber analyst, within an acceptable level of confidence? I developed an ML system that classifies cyber events based on SOC analysts' approach to classifying them and published a paper and patent based on the analysis of the model's efficacy.

## Conference Monitor ##

I developed a real-time web app to monitor the backchannel conversation (on Twitter) during academic conferences or any live event.[Paper: SocInfo'12]

## Distribution Column Overview ## 

I developed a novel way of exploring distribution data that provides an overview of distribution data and facilitates the discovery of interesting clusters, patterns, outliers, and relationships between distribution columns. [Paper: Int'l Journal of HCI]

## ManyNets ##

I co-developed this visual analytic tool for network analysis with the tabular interface. It visualizes up to several thousand network overviews and allows network comparison. [VAST Mini Challenge AWARD]

## G-Pare ##

I developed this visual analytic tool to compare uncertain graphs, provide different views to see the overview of two graphs, as well as focus views that show subsets of nodes of interest. [Paper: VAST '11]

## Wrong Patient Error ##
I developed this project investigating the user interface and human factor issues in EHR systems that cause the problem of selecting the wrong patient. We suggest user interface techniques that can avoid this class of error and improve patient safety.
